#Call of Duty Match Tracker

The project uses the cod-api wrapper to get real time Warzone stats from the Activision API; calculating player performance metrics and shows them with charts.

#Features
- Tracks and displays:
- K/D ratio over time
- Accuracy trends
- Weapon usage distribution
- Fetches up to 20 recent Warzone matches

#Note
When submitting, Activision's API is temporarily down. The code is functional and will run properly once the API is back.
